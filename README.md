The purpose behind this website is to organize the research I did over my Macaulay Honors Recitation class for CSCI 127. This website contains the following points:

- the name of the neighborhood,
  
- the highlighted map from HC6 as an image
  
- the basic demographics & statistics from HC 2
  
- one paragraph summarizing your observations from HC3
  
- one paragraph summarizing your observations from HC4
  
- a summary of your results from HC7 and HC8 along with plot images, and
  
- the map from HC9 (embedded as iframe -- see below)
